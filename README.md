# Gatsby + Prime CMS

**Note:** This starter uses [The default Gatsby starter](<[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)>).

This repo contains an example website built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Prime CMS](https://github.com/birkir/prime): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-example.primecms.app/)**.

## What is Prime?

Prime is a standalone, self-hosted, headless CMS with a GraphQL interface powered by TypeScript.

## Why Prime?

There are a lot of headless SaaS solutions out there, and many of them better than Prime, but sometimes there is a need to host the CMS locally and while most open source projects work well for that, they are missing key features.
